				<h2 id="runtime-systems-engineer">Runtime Systems Engineer</h2>

				<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore">Multicore OCaml</a> project aims to bring
				native support for scalable concurrency and shared memory parallelism to the
				OCaml programming language. At its core, Multicore OCaml extends OCaml with
				<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00250">effect handlers</a> for expressing scalable
				concurrency, and a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11663">high-performance concurrent garbage
				collector</a> aimed at responsive networked
				applications. Multicore OCaml is also the first industrial-strength language to
				be equipped with <a href="https://kcsrk.info/papers/pldi18-memory.pdf">an efficient yet modular memory
				model</a>, allowing high-level local
				program reasoning while retaining performance. Multicore OCaml is actively being
				developed and core features are being <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pulls?q=label%3Amulticore-prerequisite+">upstreamed to
				OCaml</a>.</p>
